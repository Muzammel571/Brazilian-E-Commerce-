 marketing performance. 

4.The goal is to deliver actionable insights for optimizing e-commerce operations and marketing strategies.

**Project Structure**

I). The dataset, originally downloaded from Kaggle in CSV format, has been uploaded to the database as Brazilian E-Commerce.

II).Data Analysis And Finding

1.	Customer Dataset:

*) Retrieve the total number of customers per state.

*) List all unique cities in the customer_city column.

2.	Geo Location:

*) Identify the states with the most geolocation entries.

*) Find all cities where the geolocation_zip_code_prefix is shared by more than one city.

3.	Order Item:

*) Retrieve the total revenue (price) from all orders.
  	
*) Calculate the average freight_value for delivered orders.

4.	Order Payment:

*) Count the number of orders made using each payment_type.
  	
*) Find the total payment_value for orders with more than one installment.

5.	Order Dataset:

*)	Retrieve the list of orders that were delivered after their estimated delivery date.
  	
*)	Calculate the average delivery time for orders (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp).

6.	Joining Tables:

*)	Find the total revenue (price) generated by each seller by joining Order_Item and Seller_Dataset.
